# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

What the R script does.

It downloads a zip file from the following url:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Then unzip the file into a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset".

The result file finds itself inside the folder, called "result.txt"
